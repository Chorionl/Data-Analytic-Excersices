 SQL Practice:
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries created for learning and practicing core SQL concepts using a simple **Employees – Departments – Projects** database.

The goal of this project is to understand how to:
- Write basic 'SELECT' queries
- Use 'WHERE' filters (numbers, strings, dates)
- Perform 'JOIN' operations between tables
- Apply aggregations ('COUNT', 'SUM','AVG')
- Use 'GROUP BY' and 'HAVING'
- Create conditional logic with 'CASE WHEN'
- Practice 'UPDATE' statements
- Use date functions ('YEAR', 'MONTH')

- # Database Tables #

**Employees**                                             
- `employee_id`
- `first_name`, `last_name`
- `salary`
- `hire_date`
- `department_id`

**Departments**
- `department_id`
- `department_name`

**Projects**
- `project_id`
- `project_name`
- `department_id`

Additional practice includes `Customers` and `Sales`.
